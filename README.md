SOCL 302: Criminology
=====================

Fall, 2012

##Required Materials:
1 Crutchfield, Robert D., Charis E. Kubrin, George S. Bridges &
Joseph G. Weis. 2008. Crime: Readings. 3rd. Edition. Sage Publications.

2 Research articles posted on Blackboard.  See listing in “Course
Schedule” section below.  

##Course Description:
The purpose of this course is to introduce and explore substantive
topics that collectively, comprise the field of criminology,
or the systematic study of crime.  The course will cover: competing
approaches to the definition of crime; the distribution of crime over
time and across social space and social groups; theories of the
etiology and social distribution of crime; similarity or differences
in the different types or categories of crime; the life course
perspective on crime; fear of crime and its significance as a social
concept; and varying approaches to the social control of crime (i.e.,
criminal justice).  Students will learn to understand crime as both
an objective and subjective outcome that emerges from human social
organization.  The course emphasizes sociological thinking, but
criminology is an interdisciplinary field and pertinent perspectives
from biology, psychology, economics and legal studies also will be
incorporated. 

##Course Objectives:

Become familiar with varying definitions of crime and reasons
behind those definitions
Understand theories of  crime arising from sociology as well as other
relevant disciplines
Learn approaches to researching crime that are employed by
criminologists
Gain familiarity with measures of crime and why crime is a
multidimensional Coursencept that presents difficulty in measurement
Improve critical thinkingg skills; learn to effectively evaluate
criminological research
Improvee discussion abilities 

##Course Assignments:

  1. Class Attendance, Participation, In-Class writing & pop quizzes:
  Class attendance is expected.  If you must miss a class for any
  reason, you should alert Professor Ousey in advance of your absence
  and provide valid official documentation (e.g., note from doctor,
  attorney, judge, etc.) of the reasons for your absence.  Missed
  assignments may be excused at the discretion of the Professor,
  but not without valid documentation indicating the reason for your
  absence.  

  Assigned readings for each section of the course are listed in the
  topical outline presented below.  It is expected that students will
  thoroughly read and prepare to discuss these readings prior to the
  date in which they are listed on the course outline.  Some readings may
  not be explicitly discussed in class, but students are fully
  responsible for all assigned material on exams.  

  Short in-class writing assignments that provide instant assessment of
  understanding, that reinforce course lessons or that engage
  critical-thinking skills will be used periodically.  In-class writing
  assignments are part of the class participation contribution
  on the date that they are given.  Therefore, missed in-class
  assignments cannot be made up.  Class attendance, participation
  and in-class writing is worth 30 points.  

  2. Readings Journal: Students will keep a readings journal throughout
  the semester.  In this journal, it is expected that students will
  write down their reactions to and reflections on the assigned
  readings for each week.  Journal entries are somewhat open-ended in that
  students have freedom to choose what to write about in response to
  the readings.  Some possibilities include, but aren’t limited to:
    * relating the content of the article to an event in your life
  experience; 
    * relating content to current events in the world; 
    * critical commentary about why the articles or research presented in
  the article; 
    * points of confusion or questions that you have about
  the article and its content, and so on.  Reading journal entries
  should be dated and will generally be in the 1-2 page range.
  Hardcopies of typed readings journal entries are due on the last day
  of class for the semester.  The readings journals are worth 60
  points.  

  3. Exams: There will be three exams in the course.  The format of the
  exams will consist of some combination of objective-format questions
  (e.g., multiple-choice, true-false, etc.) and short-answer/essay
  questions. Each exam (including the final) is worth 150 points
  (Exams=450 points in total).
   

  4. “Fishbowl” Time: Students will be assigned to groups of 4-5.  On
  scheduled Fridays, two groups will spend roughly 20 minutes each
  “in the fishbowl”.  That is, the assigned groups will be responsible
  for leading the discussion of a particular assigned reading.  In
  advance of their fishbowl day, the designated groups should meet
  to discuss their article and to develop 4-5 high-quality questions
  that will be used to engage the rest of the class in a discussion.
  These questions can pertain directly to the content of the assigned
  article or to material that is closely related and should be familiar
  to students (e.g., current events, aspects of pop culture).  We
  will spend about 20 minutes in a discussion (for each group)
  organized around these questions. The designated group should turn
  in their discussion questions at the end of their period in the
  fishbowl.  Fishbowl time activities are worth 60 points.   

##Grades:
The grading scale used in assigning letter grades will be based upon
the percentage of the 600 possible points that you earn as follows:
```
A = 93% or higher 
A- = 90% to 92%
B+ = 87% to 89%

B   = 83% to 86% 
B- = 80% to 82%
C+ = 77% to 79%
C   = 73% to 76%
C- = 70% to 72%
D+= 67% to 69%
D = 63% to 66%
D-= 60% to 62%
F = 59% or below    
```
