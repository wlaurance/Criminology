Highlighting resource inequality, social processes, and spatial interdependence, this study combines structural characteristicsfrom the
1990 census with a survey of 8,872 Chicago residents in 1995 to predict
homicide variations in 1996-1998 across 343 neighborhoods. Spatial
proximity to homicide is strongly related to increased homicide rates,
adjustingfor internal neighborhood characteristicsand priorhomicide. Spatial dynamics coupled with neighborhood inequalities in social and economic capacity are therefore consequential for
explaining urban violence. The urban village model is also premised on the notion that
networks of personal ties and associations map neatly onto the geographic
boundaries of spatially defined neighborhoods, such that neighborhoods
can be analyzed as independent social entities. The connection
of systemic social disorganization and social capital theory has been articulated by Bursik (1999): Neighborhoods bereft of social capital (e.g., interlocking social networks) are less able to realize common values and
maintain the informal social controls that foster safety. His research suggests that disadvantaged
urban neighborhoods are places where dense webs of social ties among
neighbors may impede social organization: "[I]t appears that what many
impoverished and dangerous neighborhoods have in common is a relatively high degree of social integration (high levels of local neighboring
while being relatively isolated from contacts in broader mainstream society) and low levels of informal social control (feelings that they have little
control over their immediate environment, including the environment's
negative influences on their children)" (pp. As Warren (1975) noted, the common belief that neighborhoods have declined in importance as social units
"is predicated on the assumption that neighborhood is exclusively a primary group and therefore should possess the 'face-to-face,' intimate, affective relations which characterize all primary groups" (p. The difference is mainly
one of emphasis: Although we recognize and incorporate below the relevance of systemic networks for neighborhood social organization, we
argue that collective capacity for social action, even if rooted in weak personal ties, may constitute the more proximate social mechanism for understanding between-neighborhood variation in crime rates. Applying this framework, we highlight two neglected dimensions of neighborhood context: (1) spatial
dynamics arising from neighborhood interdependence, and (2) social-institutional processes. From the standpoint of systemic theory, it is important to
account for the social and institutional ties that link residents of urban
communities to other neighborhoods, particularly those that are more spatially proximate to their neighborhood. The idea of spatial dependence thus challenges the
urban village model, which implicitly assumes that geographically defined
neighborhoods represent intact social systems that function as islands unto
themselves, isolated from the wider sociodeomographic dynamics of the
city. Moreover, to the extent that
the risk of becoming a homicide offender is influenced by contextual factors such as concentrated poverty, concentrated affluence, and collective
efficacy, spatial proximity to such conditions is also likely to influence the
risk of homicide victimization in a focal neighborhood. Thus, a homicide in one neighborhood may provide the spark that
eventually leads to a retaliatory killing in a nearby neighborhood. The diffusion perspective
focuses on the consequences of crime as they are played out over time and
space-crime in one neighborhood may be the cause of future crime in
another neighborhood. In this paper, we therefore focus on the independent effect of
spatial proximity on the likelihood of homicide, accounting for key structural and social characteristics of life within the boundaries of focal
neighborhoods. These patterns are
consistent with the inference that neighborhood structural characteristics

influence violence in part through the construct of neighborhood collec2
tive efficacy. Social cohesion and informal social control were
strongly related across neighborhood clusters (r = .80) and, following

In addition to the cohesion and control scales that define collective efficacy, our analysis takes into account institutional neighborhood processes
and social networks. The resources that affluent neighborhoods can mobilize are theoretically relevant to understanding the activation of social
control, regardless of dense social ties and other elements of social capital
that may be present. In the
latter period (1996-1998), the homicide count for each neighborhood cluster is based
on the number of "incidents" that occurred there, where each incident may contain one

 MORENOFF ET AL. This contrasts with the 1991-1993 homicide data, in which the neighborhood count is based on the number of victims that were murdered in each neighborhood in a given year. Our model views the homicide count

Yi for a given neighborhood as sampled from an overdispersed Poisson
distribution with mean niAi, where ni is the population size in 100,000s of
neighborhood i and Ai is the latent or "true" homicide rate for neighborhood i per 100,000 people. Raudenbush et
al., 2000), we set the natural log link rj, = log(A
1 ) equal to a mixed linear
model that includes relevant neighborhood covariates, a random effect for
each neighborhood, plus a spatial autocorrelation term. However, if a significant association between social process and homicide maintains after partialling the effect of prior
homicide, endogeneity is an implausible inference in our panel model because the
homicide outcome is measured at a later time than the predictors; Third, the approach incorporates the spatial dependence of neighborhood homicide rates. The approximate posterior mode i" for neighborhood i is a weighted average
of that neighborhood's log homicide rate, estimated using only the data from that
neighborhood; The more data collected in neighborhood i, the more precise will be the estimate based on the data from that neighborhood and the more weight
it will be accorded in composing rj*. This
interpretation would seem to suggest a diffusion process, whereby a high
homicide rate in one neighborhood diffuses outward and affects homicide
rates in surrounding neighborhoods. However, the notion of diffusion
implies a process that occurs over time, whereas the spatial autocorrelation process modeled in Equation (1) is entirely cross-sectional-homicide
rates are spatially interrelated across neighborhoods but simultaneously
determined. The first component
(the spatial process in the X variables) directly addresses the "proximity
hypothesis" discussed above-it estimates the extent to which homicide
rates are related to values of the measured X variables in spatially proximate neighborhoods.1 3 The second component of Equation (2) (the spatial process in E) is more ambiguous and depends on the model
specification. In part, this component taps the effect of spatial proximity
to unmeasured features in nearby neighborhoods that are associated with
homicide. For example, the homicide rate of the focal neighborhood may
be related to rates in surrounding areas because of overlapping social networks across arbitrary neighborhood boundaries. Another possibility is a
spillover effect such that the homicide rate in the focal neighborhood is
affected by the homicide rate in nearby neighborhoods directly. We thus examined
the geographic correspondence between the distribution of neighborhood
homicide rates and that of collective efficacy, a key social process from our
theoretical perspective. To facilitate such a comparison, we employ a
typology of spatial association, referred to as a Moran scatterplot, which
classifies each neighborhood based on its value for a given variable, y, and
the weighted average of y in contiguous neighborhoods, as captured by the
spatial lag term, Wy. For simplicity, neighborhoods that are above the
mean on y are considered to have "high" values of y, whereas neighborhoods below the mean are classified as "low." The same distinction is
made with respect to values of Wy for each neighborhood, resulting in a
fourfold classification with the following categories: (1) low-low, for neighborhoods that have low levels of efficacy and are also proximate to neighborhoods with low levels of efficacy; For example, 67 of the 93 neighborhoods
that have spatial clustering of high levels of collective efficacy (72%) also
experience statistically significant clustering of low homicide. Most of the
clustering of low homicide coupled with high collective efficacy occurs in
neighborhoods located on the western boundaries of Chicago, particularly
on the far northwest and southwest sides. For example, 14 of the 93
homicide cold spots (15%) appear in neighborhoods with low levels of
collective efficacy that are surrounded by high levels. Moreover, 15 of 103
homicide hot spots (15%) are in neighborhoods that have high levels of
collective efficacy but are surrounded by neighborhoods with low levels.
The role of spatial proximity to collective efficacy is further explored in
Figure 2, which graphs the mean homicide rate for the four categories of
the collective efficacy spatial typology.15 Figure 2 reveals that regardless
of the level of collective efficacy in the focal neighborhood, mean homicide rates are lower among neighborhoods that are spatially proximate to
high levels of collective efficacy (as indicated by the dark gray bars) than
they are among neighborhoods that are spatially proximate to low levels
of collective efficacy (as indicated by the dotted bars). It is therefore clear
that a neighborhood's spatial proximity to collective efficacy conditions its
homicide rate, independent of its level of collective efficacy.

Adults per child multiplied by 100. When social and institutional processes
are added to the regression, in model 2, only the effects of disadvantage
(positive), residential stability (positive), and density (negative) remain
significant.1 7 More importantly, model 2 also reveals that collective effi-

cacy is negatively related to homicide rates, as anticipated by the theoretical discussion. Model 4
adds a control for the prior neighborhood homicide rate (1991-1993) in
order to address the possibility that the association between collective efficacy in 1995 and 1996-1998 homicide rates is really a reflection of the
downward spiral of neighborhoods caused by prior violence.18 The control for prior homicide reduces the magnitude of the collective efficacy
coefficient (by 13%), but it still maintains significance. The control for
prior homicide reduces the disadvantage coefficient more substantially (by
33%), but because 1991-1993 homicide rates and the logged disadvantage
index are so highly correlated (r = .90), it is difficult to disentangle their
independent effects on 1996-1998 homicide rates. More important from
the standpoint of our theoretical discussion above is that collective efficacy
and the spatial term maintain significant and strong associations with variations in future homicide unaccounted for by the stable patterns of violence as reflected in prior homicide. What is unique about models 5 and 6 is the
cities may indeed have higher homicide rates), but it is less applicable to the neighborhood level because many of the most devastated and poor areas within cities of the
North and Midwest are those that became "depopulated" during the social dislocations
of the 1970s and 1980s (Wilson, 1987). The maps revealed that the association between high neighborhood
density and low homicide rates appears to be strongest in affluent neighborhoods on
the city's North Side, where there are many high-rise apartment buildings. To be sure,
there are also neighborhoods with high density and high homicide rates-such as those
with high-rise public housing-but it is more generally the case that the neighborhoods
with the highest homicide rates (e.g., on the West and South Sides) have relatively low
levels of population density. This finding dovetails with results from prior longitudinal
research in Chicago on the association between neighborhood population loss-which
tends to result in lower levels of population density-and higher homicide rates (Morenoff and Sampson, 1997). and 1990 Census

with a 9% increase in the homicide rate in the focal neighborhood according to the Police data and a 4% increase according to Vital Statistics.

argued above, the high degree of racial segregation overlaid with poverty
hinders our ability to disentangle the direct effects of neighborhood racial
23
composition and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage in Chicago. We address this
issue by estimating spatial regime models (Anselin, 1995a), which allow
coefficients to vary across regimes defined by neighborhood racial composition while controlling for spatial dependence. 24 To define these regimes,
we divide Chicago's neighborhoods into two categories based on their
1990 racial composition: (1) less than 75% non-Hispanic black (henceforth
referred to as "non-black" neighborhoods) and (2) 75% or more non-Hispanic black (henceforth, referred to as "black" neighborhoods). Coefficients from the Regression of Empirical
Bayes Poisson Homicide Rates on Neighborhood Predictors
by Racial Regimes: 1990-1998 Chicago Police Data; 26
The ICE index and collective efficacy have significant negative associations with the homicide incident rate in both non-black and black neighborhoods. 27 In the victimbased homicide model, the ICE index is significantly associated with homicide only in non-black neighborhoods, whereas the association between
collective efficacy and homicide is significant only in black neighborhoods. Although there is evidence of differing magnitudes of effect across black and non-black neighborhoods, the overall
results for collective efficacy and spatial proximity are fairly robust, taking
both homicide outcomes into account.

DISENTANGLING NEIGHBORHOOD
SYSTEMIC PROCESSES
Although the regression results affirm that collective efficacy in achieving social control is an important factor for understanding variation in
neighborhood homicide rates, they are less sanguine about the role of
social ties. Both Tables I and 2 show that there is no independent association between social ties and neighborhood homicide rates after controlling
for collective efficacy. These findings offer insight on the social disorganization tradition of recent neighborhood research, much of which focuses
on the role of social ties. From the standpoint of the systemic perspective, we expect homicide rates to be lowest in neighborhoods that possess high levels of both
social ties and collective efficacy. Most of the neighborhoods where
low homicide rates are clustered despite the absence of strong social ties
are on the north side of the city. The traditional perspective on social
disorganization predicts that homicide "hot" spots should be found
predominantly in neighborhoods that are low in both ties and efficacy. Integrating the collective efficacy and systemic model, we would
suggest that social ties create the capacity for informal social control, but it
is the act of exercising control that is related to crime rather than the existence of social networks per se (Bursik, 1999). One interpretation of this finding is that the spatial dependence term is significant in model 1 because it captures the effects of social ties and interactions that cut
across neighborhood boundaries, along with similarities across neighborhoods on unobserved social and institutional process variables. Maximum Likelihood Coefficients from the
