Stigma & Collateral Consequences of Punishment
----------------------------------------------

Week 11

###Sequencing Disadvantage

Why were the interviewees not all given the same formatted resume? I
suppose this would have caused suspicion amongst duplicate employers. I would
expect the results of non-offender / ex-offender to be proportional
between whites and blacks. It seems employers timidness to hire blacks
is amplified when the black candidate has a criminal record. 
31 / 22 = 1.4 and 25 / 10 = 2.5

The article discusses how the chance to talk to the person actually
doing the hiring will give the ex-offender a chance to explain the
charges and parole references on their resume. My consensus is that some
employers wouldn't want the risk of hiring an ex-con when there are
other job applicants out there. Especially in a rural setting such as
Williamsburg and when local small business are concerned. 

But perhaps those small businesses are passing up some great talent.
Anthony, an African American tester, found this to be true when he
interviewed with the manager of the health care company. 

Personally if I owned a business that relied on proficient and hard
workers I would hire an ex-con looking to get her shit together. Why
not? If it turns out they are a lousy worker or they commit a crime I
can fire them ( depending on what state I'm in). But bottom line is they
need a fresh start, a second chance and steady employment will help them
keep it together.

This article unfortunately reveals racism in America's ugly head once
again. This study shows that blacks are less likely to get jobs for
non-offenders and ex-offenders. What will this attitude lead to? I
believe it will only compound the effects and cause incarceration rates
amongst blacks to increase. The article stated that 60% of inmates
released go back to jail in 3 years. That is a sad fact. 

### Labeling, Life Changes, and Adult Crime

"First, deviant labeling may influence subsequent deviance by altering
the person's self concept". So by labeling someone there exists a point
where the labeled person will subdue themselves to the label and alter
their self concept to match the label. If a girl is called a slattern for
weeks on end and everyone thinks she is a slattern it would be much easier
for the girl's self image to be that of a slattern's. 

This article deals with labeling adolescents and how this can lead them
to a life of crime in adulthood. I somewhat feel that we will outgrow
our labels. People seem to forget about those 'labeled' people from high
school. They grow up and mature (most of them) and realize the label
associated with that person wasn't true to begin with. Perhaps my view
of this is skewed but this is what I believe. Unless a adolescent got
started early with crime and acquired a label from the courts as a
'felon' or 'criminal' or 'clinically insane' I doubt that any other peer 
given label would last very long. 

Like the cult classic 'The Hangover' reminds us, "What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas... except for herpes, that shit will come back with you."
Same goes for a criminal record. As discussed in the previous article
this can hurt your chances of getting a job especially if you are black
and do not get to talk with the hiring manager.

One part I disagree with in the article is "Official intervention, such
as being arrested, convicted, or sent to a mental hospital, does not
automatically lead to deviant labeling". I'm sorry but if someone tried
to kill themselves and they were sent to a mental hospital, when they
returned to their peers, they will get labeled. Kids are cruel. 

An interesting find in the article to me is, "...However, Bodwitch
provides some evidence that may account for these effects In an
ethnographic study of high school students, Bodwitch found that students
who are defined as troublemakers are disciplined by school officials in
ways that conspire to push students out of school". To me this sounds
like a breeding ground for violent criminals. If school officials are
will to kick 'trouble makers' out of school with those labels/stigmas
attached, they are asking for trouble.

In the article's conclusion they say blacks are more likely to get
labels because there is already a underlying stereotype associated with
their race. Why do blacks have this stereotype?
