The Paradox of Social Organization
----------------------------------

Week 8

Neighboorhood crime is an interesting topic because the social
organization and social structure can sometimes facilitate crime and
make it worth while to the offender to invoke these crimes.

The collective efficacy in a crime stricken neighborhood is very low in
my opinion. Typically where gangs exist or mob mentalities are in play,
neighbors are highly unlikely to stick their necks out for a fellow
neighbor if they are getting jump in the street. This study took place
in Chicago where a lot of neighborhoods are crime stricken.

I find interesting Whyte's 1937 classic account of an Itailian American
community in Boston showed that active/dense social ties and
neighborhood attachment promostes the regulation of local crime. I would
think that close neighborhood ties would led to peace and little crime
for said neighborhood. Wilson adds to this to say in low social control
neighborhoods, networks serve to disseminate potentially detrimental
behavioral orientations. Wilson discusses, how children are at a
disadvantage because the "social interaction among neighbors tends to be
confined to those whose skills, styles, orientations, and habits are not
as conducive to promoting positive social outcomes."

I suppose this makes sense. If you live in neighborhood where the Adults
are ex-felons, criminals, and just bad people, the children in the
neighborhood who make bonds with these people, their neightbors, are
likely to fall into the same patterns of crime and bad behavior.

Cultural transmission works well in favor of crime for network density
areas where attitudes tolerating deviance are shared.

I can definitely relate to the story of the woman who did not call the
police on the boy from Groveland because she knew the boys mother.
Growing up a neighborhood kid would do something stupid but rather than
calling the police a parent would contact the 'offenders' parent and
handle it that way. In some instances the kid learned and did not
offend anymore. There were a few kids in my neighborhood that perhaps
if the cops punished them they would not be in jail today.
