Anomie Strain Theory
--------------------
Week 9

Anomie strain theory points to the individual as causes of crime. In
particular it nails down the cause as the individual's pathology.

Being a William and Mary Student I have faced the road blocks and
overcame them so far. However I have a friend who went a different path
to go around the same road blocks I encountered.

My friend, we'll call him Larry, and I were friends since middle school.
We got into trouble together throughout high school, but senior year we
finally got our act together. We took the advance classes and studied
together and both resulted with all A's that year. Larry and I went on
to attend a local community college where we both entered the Comp Sci
program. We challenged each other for the first year and we both had 4.0
GPA. After the first year Larry had run out of money for school. He
comes from a lower income family and could have easily applied for
scholarships/grants to get help for school. He didn't want to take
anyones charity so he made the money for himself by dealing drugs. At
first it was just to help pay for school, but eventually greed got the
best of him. I continued on the plan Larry and I had set out our first
year at community college, that is to earn bachelor's degrees in comp
sci from William and Mary. Larry dropped out of community college to
pursue his career as a criminal.

He was fairly successful in the local drug trade and stealing items of
value such as GPS, laptops, and other electronics. To my knowledge he
has not been caught for any serious crimes except for possession
charges. 

I know Larry and I both want monetary success. I could have easily
gratified myself in the drug trade with Larry but I chose a different
path. We faced similar roadblocks and hurdles but in the end our paths
diverged.

I believe the biggest reasons for the divergent paths is Larry and I's
different social structure. Larry did not have the best home life. His
parents do drugs and also are involved in some light criminal acts. My family is
involved in the community and well educated.

This is a good example of what Merton believes, "...Merton argued that the 
system of stratification in the United States is  a source of both social
and income inequality." Larry simply innovated in a deviant way to
achieve his American Dream.

One section I found interesting was the "Personal Traits of Conditioning
Variables". I find it intriguing that we can lump human traits into a
master set of variables or a top 5. Negative emotionality is most most
relevant to GST. I feel that negative emotionality is more of a gateway
that allows the other traits to overtake the person. That said I believe
that constraint should be the 'master variable'. 

I feel that the future with strain theory will highly rely on
advancements in computing and biology, particularly high performance
cluster computing and the human genome project. Rather than these 5
master traits, which are most likely caused by specific genes and
environmental factors, we will be able to analyze people and better
predict their traits and their likeness to commit crimes.
