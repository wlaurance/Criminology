#Shifting Approaches to Punishment Control of Crime

America loves the death penalty. Growing up in Virginia, I observed a
competition like environment for how many convicts were executed. The
main competition was Texas and Virginia is the runner up. 

These articles investigated the alternatives to corpal punishment,
incarceration, and the reactions there of.

One alternative to incarceration, at least first time offending youths,
is family group conferencing. FGC helps youths fight Deviance theory and
helps them realize the harm they have caused their victims. Growing up I
had peers in public schools who had commited minor crimes and went to
counciling rather than a direct route to a trial. Personally I think
this route helped prevent a majority of them steer to the right path. It
gave them the ability to not suffer 'labeling' by a conviction. 

FGR is just one way the punishment control can shift. I believe for non
hardened criminals, a different approach needs to be taken. Similar to
Europe, the U.S. needs to not treat simple drug charges as if the person
has commited murder or another violent crime.
