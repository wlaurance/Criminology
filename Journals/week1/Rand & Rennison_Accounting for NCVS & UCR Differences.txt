WINDOW ON
WASHINGTON
Daniel Cork and Michael Cohen,
Column Editors

Column Editors’ Note: Every year, the results of two large
data collection efforts are used to gauge the problem of crime
in America. These two data series are intended to measure
different aspects of crime, but this point is often lost in the
front-page headline summaries of whether crime is “up,”
“down,” or about the same. Confusion regarding the two crime
indicators is exacerbated when the two data series show substantially different trends, as was the case with the most
recent release of data in 2001. For this column, we asked
Michael Rand and Callie Rennison of the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics to describe the two national crime indicators
and their differences. Their article clearly describes the distinct approaches to measuring crime used by these two data
series, and provides a strong justiﬁcation for maintaining these
two approaches to address very distinct policy needs.
Just a thought... A previous Window on Washington column from summer 1998 discussed the U.S. Census Bureau’s
Small-Area Income and Poverty Estimates Program, which
used administrative records and census data in conjunction
with Current Population Survey estimates to produce modelbased small-area estimates that incorporated information
from all these sources. It would be interesting to see if a similar approach might be used to provide small-area estimates
of violent crime, possibly by ﬁtting a regression model to the
National Crime Victimization Survey data, using the Uniform Crime Reports and other data as explanatory variables.
Such approaches to combine information from the two
national crime indicators—continuing efforts to reﬁne inferences from two frequently confused data series—are interesting possibilities for future research.

True Crime Stories? Accounting
for Differences in Our National
Crime Indicators
Michael R. Rand and
Callie M. Rennison
In May 2001, the FBI released preliminary estimates from
the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, showing that
violent crime in the United States had stabilized in 2000 after
several years of decline. Two weeks later, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) released ﬁndings from the National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) indicating that in 2000
the violent crime rate had fallen by 15 percent from its 1999
level, the greatest percentage decline in the survey’s 28-year
history.
At the time of the NCVS release, the media reported that
“criminologists were at a loss to explain the difference
between the two sets of ﬁgures” (Irish Independent, June 15,
2001), that “it’s possible that both are correct” (Washington
Post, June 19, 2001), that “the Justice Department and many
statisticians regard the victim survey as a more accurate gauge
of actual crime than the FBI study” (Washington Post, June
14, 2001) and that “most criminologists regard the FBI’s
report as the more valid yardstick” (USA Today, June 15,
2001). Each of these statements reﬂects confusion about the
purposes, advantages, and disadvantages of the UCR and the
NCVS.

UCR and NCVS
The UCR and NCVS are the U.S. Department of Justice’s
two national measures of crime in the United States. The
UCR, the older of the two programs, is compiled from
monthly reports transmitted to the FBI from law enforcement agencies across the country, either directly or through
centralized state agencies. It was begun in 1929 to provide
information at the national level on a set of serious crimes
reported to local law enforcement agencies. The crimes
selected for inclusion in the UCR Program were chosen
because they were considered both serious offenses and
likely to be reported to the police. The speciﬁc crime types
monitored by the UCR Program are referred to as “Index
Crimes,” and they are used to form a composite Crime Index
of offenses known to law enforcement
The NCVS is a victimization survey conducted from a large
sample of U.S. households. First ﬁelded in 1972, the survey
was designed to serve as a benchmark for UCR statistics on
crime reported to police; to measure what was called “the dark
ﬁgure of unreported crime”; and to ﬁll a perceived need for
information on the characteristics of crime not provided by
the UCR. The President’s Commission on Law Enforcement
and the Administration of Justice, established by President
Johnson, noted in a task force report that, “If we knew more
about the character of both offenders and victims, the nature
of their relationships and the circumstances that create a high
probability of crime conduct, it seems likely that crime prevention programs could be made much more effective” (President’s Commission, 1967). It is therefore no surprise that
the types of crime measured by the NCVS are similar to those
measured by the UCR; (see Table 1).
Both programs are essential because crime, unlike the
weather, is a phenomenon that is not directly observable. No
one measure is capable of providing all the information about
the extent and characteristics of crime. The UCR measures
crimes that are reported to law enforcement agencies across
the Nation, while the NCVS measures crimes that people
have experienced, whether or not reported to police. “Because
the UCR and NCVS programs are conducted for different
purposes, use different methods, and focus on somewhat different aspects of crime, the information they produce
together provides a more comprehensive panorama of the
Nation’s crime problem than either could produce alone”
(U.S. Department of Justice, 2000).
Since the NCVS and UCR measure the same general set
of offenses, there is some expectation that the two programs
would provide similar portraits of the Nation’s crime problem. The two programs have often, but not always, presented
similar year-to-year crime change estimates. Since 1972, yearto-year violent crime change estimates from the NCVS and
UCR moved in the same direction, either up or down, about
3/5 of the time. Property crime rates have moved in the same
direction about 3/4 of the time. The period 1994 to 1999 was
the longest for which the UCR and NCVS both moved in
the same direction. The differences found in the 2001 release
therefore seemed more shocking because they diverged from
a long period of agreement between the two measures.
The reality is that the differences between the two programs—in terms of their purposes, methods and even

offenses measured—are considerable. Once these methodological differences are understood, the differences in estimates become more comprehensible. The UCR and NCVS
measure different aspects of the crime problem, much the
same way that the S&P Indexes and Dow Jones Averages measure different aspects of the stock market.

Nature of Differences Between NCVS
and UCR
Because the UCR and NCVS are conducted for different
purposes, their differences are substantial. They use different data collection methods and measure an overlapping—
but not identical—set of offenses against an
overlapping—but not identical—population. Even the way
the two programs count offenses and calculate crime rates
differs. Moreover, these different approaches provide the
two programs with their unique strengths that allow them to
fulﬁll the different purposes for which they were designed.
One of the greatest differences between the UCR and
NCVS may be the most obvious, but is often overlooked in
the headlines and news articles. The UCR measures only
crimes reported to law enforcement agencies throughout the
country, while the NCVS measures both reported and unreported crime. The New York Times article on the May 2001
FBI release opened, “The number of serious crimes in the
United States remained steady last year…” Nowhere in the
opening paragraphs was it mentioned that the data were
based on crimes reported to police and exclude unreported
crime.
Another difference between the UCR and NCVS is their
population coverage. The UCR measures crimes reported to
law enforcement agencies committed against any person or
entity in the country. This includes young children, visitors
from other countries, and businesses or organizations. The
NCVS measures crimes against people age 12 or older and
their households. It excludes crimes committed against young
children, businesses or other organizations, and people without a permanent residence in the United States.
The crime coverage of the two programs is similar, but
there are some important differences. The UCR includes
homicide and arson, neither of which are measured by the

chance

NCVS, while the survey measures simple assault—the most
common violent crime but an offense not included in the
UCR’s set of measured Index Crimes.
Additionally, the NCVS and UCR deﬁne some crimes differently, and use different protocols to categorize and count
crimes. For example, the UCR deﬁnes rape as “the carnal
knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will,” and
excludes rapes of males and other forms of sexual assault. The
NCVS measures rape and sexual assault of women and men.
The basic counting unit of the NCVS is the victimization. A victimization is deﬁned as “a speciﬁc criminal act as
it affects a single victim, whether a person or household”
(Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2001). In crimes against people (rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault, or purse snatching
or pocket picking), the number of victimizations is equal to
the number of victims. For crimes against households (theft,
household burglary, and motor vehicle theft), the crime is
assumed to involve one victim, the affected household. Rates
of violent crime are calculated as the number of victimizations per 1,000 people age 12 or older. For crimes against
households, rates are per 1,000 households.
The basic counting unit for the UCR is the offense. For
some crimes, such as assault and rape, the frequency of
offense is equal to the number of victims. For other crimes,
such as burglary or robbery, the number of offenses equals
the number of incidents. All UCR crime rates, regardless of
the victim (individual or organization), are calculated on a per
capita basis: the number of offenses per 100,000 people. For
some crimes, the NCVS and UCR counting rules are similar. If in an incident two people were threatened by someone
with a knife, both programs would count two aggravated
assaults. (For the NCVS, this assumes that both victims were
in sample. If only one was in sample, the survey’s procedures
that weight estimates to national totals would account for the
other victimization.)
For other crimes, such as robbery, the programs differ in
signiﬁcant ways. For example, if two people were robbed on
the street by an armed gunman, the UCR would count one
offense, but the NCVS would, if both people were in sample, count two victimizations. Additionally, if a bank teller
was threatened by an armed assailant during a bank robbery,
the UCR would count this as a robbery with a weapon. The
NCVS, which measures only crimes against people and their
households, would classify the crime as an aggravated assault
victimization (assuming that no personal property was stolen
from the teller).
Both the UCR and the NCVS are subject to limitations
and sources of error associated with their respective methodologies that impact the quality, accuracy, and reliability of
estimates and hence affect comparisons between the two
programs. As a voluntary program, the UCR is subject to
incomplete reporting by local jurisdictions. In addition, the
submissions of some jurisdictions sometimes do not meet
the FBI’s guidelines for completeness and accuracy. The FBI
has developed protocols to impute data to adjust for nonparticipating jurisdictions and those reporting partial data.
However, the degree of imputation at the national level is
not small and varies in magnitude from year to year. “Complete data for Illinois, for example, have not been included
in the UCR since 1985, initially because the Illinois statu-

tory deﬁnition of sexual assault is inconsistent with the UCR
deﬁnition of rape, and since 1992 because the Illinois UCR
submissions did not adhere to the UCR’s ‘hierarchy rule’,” a
protocol for classifying crimes according to their most serious element (Maltz, 1999).
Like all sample surveys, the NCVS is subject to sampling
error, and conﬁdence intervals are supplied for the resulting
survey estimates to account for sampling variability. For example, the estimated violent crime rate for 2000 was 27.9 victimizations per 1,000 people age 12 and older. The 95%
conﬁdence interval around this estimate is 25.85 to 29.95
victimizations per 1,000 people age 12 and older.
NCVS estimates are also subject to nonsampling error.
Though every effort is taken to reduce nonsampling error, an
unquantiﬁed amount remains in all data collections. One
source of nonsampling error in the NCVS derives from the
inability of some respondents to recall in detail the crimes
which occurred during the six-month reference period. Some
victims also may not report crimes committed by offenders
who are not strangers, especially if they are relatives. In addition, for some persons, assaultive violence may be a part of
their everyday life, and they may therefore either forget such
incidents or not consider them important enough to mention to a survey interviewer. These recall problems may result
in an underestimate of the actual rate of victimization.
Series victimizations represent another source of error in
victimization rates and counts. A series victimization is
deﬁned as six or more similar but separate crimes which the
victim is unable to recall individually or describe in detail to
an interviewer. Series victimizations are an issue because in
the NCVS, crime classiﬁcation is based upon the respondent’s answers to several questions. Some people who are
victimized repeatedly cannot provide the information
required to classify every incident that they experienced. If
the person was the victim of six or more similar crimes during the six-month reference period, and cannot provide the
details about each incident, one report is taken for the entire
series of victimizations. Details of the most recent incident
are obtained, and the victimization is counted as a single (1)
victimization. This procedure may also result in an underestimate of the actual rate of victimization.

Impact of Programmatic Differences
on Crime Trends
Because it is based on crimes reported to police, the UCR is
not a measure of all crime occurring in the United States,
even for the offenses that it measures. Police reporting is
related to a variety of factors. NCVS data have shown that
people tend to report crimes to police for a wide variety of
reasons: to recover property or make an insurance claim, to
end the incident, to prevent future crimes to themselves or
others, or just because a crime was committed. There are,
similarly, a number of reasons why people do not report crimes:
mistrust of police or the criminal justice system, a belief that
the police would not act, a feeling that the incident was not
important enough, fear of reprisal or embarrassment, or a
belief that the incident was a private or personal matter.

Figure 1. Four measures of serious violent crime.

Many of the reasons inﬂuencing people to either report
or not report crime may be affected by public policy at all
levels of government, as well as by a variety of other factors,
all of which can change over time. Changes in the way rape
victims are treated may encourage other victims to report their
victimizations. So might community efforts to clean up neighborhoods. Conversely, lack of adequate police manpower to
take reports may discourage crime victims from reporting. It
is therefore possible for crime reported to police, as measured by the UCR, to rise or fall independent of the change
in overall crime (reported and unreported crime), as measured by the NCVS.
In fact, in 2000 the NCVS did measure an increase in
reporting of crime to police. The percentage of violent crimes
reported to police rose from 44 to 48%. Reports of property
crime rose from 34 to 36%. The steep 1999–2000 decline
measured by the NCVS largely resulted from a decline in
crimes victims said they did not report to police. Violent
crimes not reported to police fell by 20%, while violent crimes
victims said they reported to police fell by 6%. Virtually the
entire decline in simple assault, the least serious violent
crime and an offense not measured by the UCR, was from
simple assaults not reported to police.
The impact of other differences between the programs is
measurable to varying degrees. Some percentage of the rapes,
robberies, and aggravated assaults measured by the UCR
were committed against children under age 12, but no source
of recurring national data exists to provide ongoing estimates
of this percentage. On the other hand, the UCR provides
50

VOL. 15, NO. 1, 2002

some information about the circumstances of robberies. In
1999, for example, about a third of robberies and burglaries
were committed against commercial entities such as stores,
ofﬁces, banks, and service stations (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2000). Because such victimizations are measured
by the UCR but not by the NCVS, if there is variation over
time in the percentage of crimes against children under 12
or in crimes against commercial establishments, only the
UCR measure of crime and crime trends would be affected.

Assessing 1999–2000 Change
Estimates
While it is not possible to remove every difference between
the NCVS and UCR, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has
developed a procedure that allows for comparison of the
types of crime common to both programs. This procedure
entails removing crimes against children under 12 and commercial robberies from the UCR, removing simple assault
and crimes not reported to police from the NCVS, and adding
homicides to the NCVS. Figure 1 is based on a chart from
the BJS website that presents four measures of serious violent crime derived from the NCVS and UCR. The top curve
represents the overall NCVS estimate of serious violent crime
(rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, with homicide data
added from the UCR). The curves labeled “Victimizations
reported to police” and “Crimes recorded by police” present

data modiﬁed to eliminate, to the extent possible, incongruous elements. They represent, respectively, NCVS victims
of serious violent crime who said they reported the crime to
the police and the UCR estimate of reported violent crime.
A comparison of the two measures using this procedure
results in a convergence in their long-term trends and less
disparity in year-to-year change estimates. While overall
NCVS violent crime declined by 15% in 2000, serious violent crime (rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) reported
to police declined by 11%. (UCR estimates for 2000 are not
shown in Fig. 1 because ﬁnal UCR data for 2000, required
to make adjustments, were not available at the time this article was prepared.)

Summary
The UCR and NCVS programs are conducted for different
purposes, use different methods, and focus on somewhat different aspects of crime. Together, they tell us that crime is
pervasive. This is evident whether we consider the victim’s
perspective or that of law enforcement. The way the United
States measures crime is efﬁcient and practical. In fact, other
countries have emulated our approach and simultaneously collect information from victims and law enforcement agencies.
Rather than being problematic, independent measures of
a social issue are valuable. In the economic area, economists
use many indicators which often conﬂict to get a more comprehensive picture of the economy of the nation. We need
NCVS, since as much as two-thirds of property crime and
half of all violent crime are not reported to police. The NCVS
is the only national forum that victims have to inform us about
crimes they are reluctant to report to police. We need the
UCR, since it is the only national data series that provides
information by state and city, and it is the only system that
compiles administrative records from local police departments to tell us how much crime has been reported to police

throughout the United States. Together, the measures
enhance our understanding of crime.
One of the questions raised in the media as a result of
the UCR and NCVS releases was, “Which is the better measure of crime?” This question misstates the issue and is based
on a misunderstanding of the relationship between the two
programs. Both are the better measure for what they are
intended to measure. The UCR provides information on the
amount of crime reaching law enforcement, and can help
inform police departments on their manpower needs. The
NCVS provides a national picture of what people are experiencing, what proportion of crime does not reach police, the
characteristics associated with offenses, and the consequences and costs of crime. Crime, like other phenomena,
must be examined from a number of perspectives in order
to fully understand it.
