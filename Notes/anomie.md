Anomie
======

Durkheim: Anomie as normlessness
--------------------------------

### **Anomie** is defined as a state of normlessness. 
  * Society loses its ability to regulate behavior
  * Occurs during periods of rapid social change
  * Social change breaks down constraint & unleashes the "human will"
    * "Inextinguishable thirst is constantly renewed torture" (Durkheim
      1897)

Robert Merton's Anomie/Strain Theory
------------------------------------

###Society exerts pressure towards crime.
  * How do social structures *exert definite pressure* on some
    groups/individuals to engage in deviant behavior?
  * "Integrated" societies have balance between:
    1. Culture (expected success goals)
    2. Social structure (institutional means)
  * **Anomie** occurs when a discrepancy exists between cultural success
    goals and institutional means for meeting those goals.

###Merton: Where do success goals come from?
  * Aspirations ( success goals ) are:
    * not innate or insatiable
    * learned from societal culture
  * American society: cultural success goals are same for everyone
    (universal)
    * Success goal = "show me the money!"
    * Pecuniary achievement
  * Institutionalized means of success is not equally emphasized or
    equally available to all
    * Merton: "pressure of prestige-bearing success tends to eliminate
      the effective social contraint over means employed..."
  * What happens when our path to achieve our aspirations is unavailable
    or blocked?

###Merton's Typology of Individual Adaptations
  1. **Conformity**: Individuals accept the goals & have access to the
     institutional means; stable integrated society, lower crime
  2. **Innovation**: Individuals accept the success goals but lack
     access to or reject the institutional means; volatile, influx, high
     crime society.
  3. **Ritualism**: Have access to the institutional means, but reflect
     the cultural success goals; stagnant, low-crime societies, locked in
     tradition ("neophobia")
