Anomie
======

Durkheim: Anomie as normlessness
--------------------------------

### **Anomie** is defined as a state of normlessness. 
  * Society loses its ability to regulate behavior
  * Occurs during periods of rapid social change
  * Social change breaks down constraint & unleashes the "human will"
    * "Inextinguishable thirst is constantly renewed torture" (Durkheim
      1897)

Robert Merton's Anomie/Strain Theory
------------------------------------

###Society exerts pressure towards crime.
  * How do social structures *exert definite pressure* on some
    groups/individuals to engage in deviant behavior?
  * "Integrated" societies have balance between:
    1. Culture (expected success goals)
    2. Social structure (institutional means)
  * **Anomie** occurs when a discrepancy exists between cultural success
    goals and institutional means for meeting those goals.

###Merton: Where do success goals come from?
  * Aspirations ( success goals ) are:
    * not innate or insatiable
    * learned from societal culture
  * American society: cultural success goals are same for everyone
    (universal)
    * Success goal = "show me the money!"
    * Pecuniary achievement
  * Institutionalized means of success is not equally emphasized or
    equally available to all
    * Merton: "pressure of prestige-bearing success tends to eliminate
      the effective social contraint over means employed..."
  * What happens when our path to achieve our aspirations is unavailable
    or blocked?

###Merton's Typology of Individual Adaptations
  1. **Conformity**: Individuals accept the goals & have access to the
     institutional means; stable integrated society, lower crime
  2. **Innovation**: Individuals accept the success goals but lack
     access to or reject the institutional means; volatile, influx, high
     crime society.
  3. **Ritualism**: Have access to the institutional means, but reflect
     the cultural success goals; stagnant, low-crime societies, locked in
     tradition ("neophobia")
  4. **Retreatism**: Reject goals & means
  5. **Rebellion**: Reject goals & means and actively seek to substitute
     new ones in their place.

Cloward & Lloyd Ohlin's Illegitimate Opportunity Theory
-------------------------------------------------------

Extensions of Merton's Anomie Theory: 

  * Cloward & Ohlin argued that Merton ignored the role of illegitimate
    opportunity.
  * Availability of illegitimate means of success also varies across
    society
    * Neighborhoods develop different delinquent subcultures based on
      the availability of illegitimate opportunity structures.

###Cloward & Ohlin's 3 Types of Delinquent Subcultures

  1. **Criminal Subcultures**(organized theft, racketeering)
    * stable
    * age integration
    * legititmate & illegitimate values connected
    * criminal opportunity organized & available
  2. **Conflict Subcultures**("Street" gangs; turf wards)
    * little age integration
    * little convergence of conventional & deviant values (criminal
      opportunity is disorganized)
    * crime through physical power & intimidation ("brute force") 
  3. **Retreatist Subcultures**
    * little criminal opportunity
    * dropouts from other subcultural adaptations
    * "double failures"

Macro-Social Contemporary Anomie/Strain - Institutional Anomie Theory
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Economic instutitions drive us to produce; they are source of
    "motivation" that is consistent with cultural success goals of
    Merton
  * Other institutions serve to place *constraints* on our drive for
    success goals and money (Family, welfare system, government)
  * Extreme emphasis on economic goals weakens other social institutions
    * Family life is devalued, family life organized around work
    * Schools simply train workers for economy; no intrinisic value
    * Politicians "working for the common good" are discredited as
      self-interested

Micro- Social Contemporary Anomie/Strain: Agnew's General Strain Theory
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are strains?
  * Events or social conditions that are disliked by individuals:
    * 3 Major catgories
      1. Individuals lose something they value
      2. Individuals are presented with noxious stimuli - Negative or aversive treatment by others
      3. Individuals are unable to achieve positively valued goals
  * Which is most consistent with Merton? 3.
