#Criminal offenders generally have *low self-control*
  * Here & Now mentality; can't defer
  * lack diligence & persistence: prefer easy tasks
  * adventurous physical activities rather than mental ones.
  * little interest and success pursuing long-term goals
  * act impulsively without a thought-out plan
  * are self-centered & indifferent to other's suffering
  * have low tolerance for frustration or irritants.

Low self-control is the master variable. Where does it come from?

By the age of 8, is when Godfredson and Hirschi say that self-control is
developed.

##Low Self-Control
  * Is self-control innate or socialized? Innate
  * At what age is it formed? By 8 years old
  * Does parenting matter? How? 
    * Observe, recognize, sanction
  * does self-control change across life?
    * G&H vs recent research
  * Does low self-control necessarily lead to crime? Does it *require*
    crime?
    * Crime vs. "analogous behavior"
    * What role for "criminal opportunity"

This theory was not received well because it has a pessimistic view
about reform. This is due to the fact that after age 8 people cannot be
changed.
