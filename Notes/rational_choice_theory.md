Rational Choice Theory & Deterrence Perspectives
================================================

Are crimes carefully calculated & planned?
------------------------------------------
Based on "expected utility" principle
  * People will choose a course of action based on whether they believe
    it will maximize their profits and minimize costs/losses
      * Rational action = optimal choice
  * Introduced to criminology by economists:
      * Gary Beckers's 1968 Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach.

Do offenders really calculate rewards and costs?
------------------------------------------------
  * Pure - Offender is highly rational, planful, has "full information"
    of benefits/costs & has free will
  * Partial - Image of a "reasoning offender", but not pure rationality
  * Choices are constrained or limited
    * Lack of full information
    * Morals impinge on options
    * Situational constraints, time pressures, ephemeral opportunities
