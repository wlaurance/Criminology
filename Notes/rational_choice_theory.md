================================================

Are crimes carefully calculated & planned?
------------------------------------------

  * People will choose a course of action based on whether they believe
    it will maximize their profits and minimize costs/losses
      * Rational action = optimal choice
  * Introduced to criminology by economists:
      * Gary Beckers's 1968 Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach.
