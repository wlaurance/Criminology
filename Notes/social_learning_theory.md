#Learning Theory
We are borne blank. We are no more likely to be bad then we are good. 
The central theme of the learning perspective is that deviant behavior,
like all other social behavior, is learned. Focus is on how people learn
behavior through their daily interactions. 

## Gabriel Tarde and Early Learning theory
Gabriel Tarde proposed theory of "imitation and suggestion". Crime
learned through three laws of imitation:
  * Law of close contact - we are most likely to imitate those with
    whom we have the most intimate contact.
  * Law of Imitation of Superiors by Inferiors - most likely to imitate
    those with more social status or power than us (e.g. entertainers,
    political leaders)
  * Law of Insertion ( novelty) - most likely to imitate or adopt new or
    novel behaviors.    

## Sutherland's Differential Association Theory
  1. Criminal behavior is learned.
  2. Through interaction with other people.
  3. Primarily within intimate personal groups
  4. We learn techniques, motives, drives, rationalization & attitudes
     that facilitate crime.
  5. Key part of learning is definitions of legal codes as *favorable* or *unfavorable*
  6. Criminal behavior results when definitions favorable exceed
     definitions unfavorable.
     * "Principle of differential association"
  7. Differential associations vary in frequency, duration,
     priority and intensity.
     * "Modalities of association"
  8. Learning crime follows same mechanism as learning non-crime
     * "It's nothing special"; normality of crime; normality of
     offender.

## Techniques of Neutralization
How can we violate laws that we believe in?
Gresham Sykes and David Matza
* We learn "techniques of neutralization"
  * Cognitive and verbal strategies that allow us to rationalize our
    "deviant" life to the world of conformity.
* T.O.N. "theory" recognizes that deviates live in, and often
  in-between worlds of conformity and nonconformity
1. Denial of responsibility - person recognizes that the act is wrong,
   but denies their responsibility
   * "the devil made me do it"; "it was an accident, I didn't mean it"
2. Denial of injury - person admits they did something, but denies
   that anyone was harmed.
   * Smoking marijuana does not hurt anyone
3. Denial of Victim - person admits act is considered "wrong" but
   feels it was justified; victim seen as deserving
   * vigilante justice; hate crimes
4. Condemning the condemners - denying or deflecting blame/guilt by
   attacking credibility or character of those who accuse or pass
   judgment.
   * "look who is talking"; "you got no room to judge"; "are there no
     skeletons in your closet"
5. Appeal to higher loyalties - excusing one's behavior by claiming an
   unselfish motive.
   * Dont to aid others or a larger cause
     * terrorist activites

## Ronald Akers' Social Learning Theory

Sutherland suggests that all the mechanisms of learning are present in
learning crime. Akers asks *What are the mechanisms?*

Develops theory that retains principles of differential association
theory and combines them with conditioning theories from psychology
