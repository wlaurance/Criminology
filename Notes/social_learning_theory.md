#Learning Theory
We are borne blank. We are no more likely to be bad then we are good. 
The central theme of the learning perspective is that deviant behavior,
like all other social behavior, is learned. Focus is on how people learn
behavior through their daily interactions. 

## Gabriel Tarde and Early Learning theory
Gabriel Tarde proposed theory of "imitation and suggestion". Crime
learned through three laws of imitation:
  * Law of close contact - we are most likely to imitate those with
    whom we have the most intimate contact.
  * Law of Imitation of Superiors by Inferiors - most likely to imitate
    those with more social status or power than us (e.g. entertainers,
    political leaders)
  * Law of Insertion ( novelty) - most likely to imitate or adopt new or
    novel behaviors.    

## Sutherland's Differential Association Thoery
  1. Criminal behavior is learned.
  2. Through interaction with other people.
  3. Primarily within intimate personal groups
  4. We learn techniques, motives, drives, rationalization & attitudes
     that facilitate crime.
