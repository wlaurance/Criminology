#Primary and Secondary Deviance
##Primary deviance
* Initial deviant actions; many origins; normative
##Secondary deviance
* If society response with a "stigmatizing label" the result is 
  likely to be more deviance/crime; what Edwin Lemert called secondary deviance.
  * Looking-glass-self: our self-concept reflects how we perceive that
    others view us. (Charles Horton Cooley)
  * Stigma: "spoiled identity" (Erving Goffman)
## The label of "criminal" is sticky; it is a master status
* Devah Pager's "mark of a criminal record"

# Mass Incarceration
* The current CJ policy in US has been termed "mass incarceration"
  - Nearly 2.3 million Americans are imprisoned in the U.S.
  - 1 in 104 Adults is behind bars
  - 1 in 33 under some form of supervision
  - U.S.: 5% of world's population, 25% of persons incarcerated
    worldwide
## Are our high incarceration rates needed to curb high U.S. crime rates
* For some crimes - particular lethal violence, the U.S. does have
  higher rates than other countries
* But compared to international peers, U.S. incarceration rates are
  comparatively high even controlling for differences in crime rates.
* Much of increase in incarceration is from non violent offenses,
  particularly drug offenses.

The impact of "mass incarceration" is disproportionately borne by Blacks and Hispanics.

Are race/ethnic disparities due to differential involvement in crime?
* For most crimes, racial differentials in offending are far less than
  race differences in incarceration rates.
  - Since 1970, African Americans and Hispanics have been incarcerated
    for drug crimes at much higher rates than Whites
    - ...despite higher white rates of substance use
* Labeling theorists tell us our solution to the crime problem (prison)
  may exacerbate the initial problem.
* Does imprisonment work? Does it lower the crime rate?
The evidence is ambiguous
  * Crime has generally fallen since the early 1990s, along with rising
    prison rates
  * Some research estimates that 25% of crime decline was due to
    incarceration
    - What of the other 75%? is this effect enough to justify the
      economic and social cost of mass incarceration?
  * Numerous studies indicate there is no deterrent effect of
    prision...prison does not reduce recidivism...a few even indicate
    prison may increas recidivism, esp. for low-level offenders (Cullen
    et al. 2010)
  
What are the social costs of mass incarceration?
* Prisons reproduce & perhaps exacerbate various forms of inequality;
  racial inequality in particular
  - Prisons tend to house those with the least human, financial & social
    capital
  - Incarceration amplifies disadvantages
    * Work the "convict" stigma affects whether employers will call back
    * Incarceration is strongly related to later health problems
    * Families Incarceration works to break up intact families 
      - Ex-con status dampens men's marriageability
    * Incarceration reduces *neighborhood stability*
    * Limits participation in *electoral politics/goverance
      - About 1 in 40 American adults cannot vote due to prior felony
        conviction
