#Primary and Secondary Deviance
##Primary deviance
* Initial deviant actions; many origins; normative
##Secondary deviance
* If society respons with a "stigmatizing label" the result is 
  likely to be more deviance/crime; what Edwin Lemert called secondary deviance.
  * Looking-glass-self: our self-concept reflects how we perceive that
    others view us. (Charles Horton Cooley)

* Devah Pager's "mark of a criminal record"
