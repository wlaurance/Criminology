Crime Trends & Demographic Distributions
========================================

Generally we are using UCR data.

The downward trend of crime in the later 1990s seemed to be widespread
in the US and Canada. Its important to know the context of the data.
Generally crime rates rose slowly between 1930 and 1960. Then it rose
sharply in the 1960s.
