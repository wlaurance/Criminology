Crime Trends & Demographic Distributions
========================================

Generally we are using UCR data.

The downward trend of crime in the later 1990s seemed to be widespread
in the US and Canada. Its important to know the context of the data.
Generally crime rates rose slowly between 1930 and 1960. Then it rose
sharply in the 1960s.  

* Property crime peaked in 1980
* Violent crime peaked circa 1991
* Both declined sharply in 1990s

## Predicting trends 

Recent data, through 2010 suggests that violent crime and property crime
still falling.

The Gloom and Doom predictions did not materialize. Why? Predicting the
future is a tough business. Very error prone.

We rely upon past circumstances/ relationships. The
relationships tend to be period specific. We know lots of things that
are correlated with crime. The actually mechanism/functions of these
correlations are very limited and rudimentary. 

### Best evidence
  * Increase 1984/1991/3:
    - Crack-cocaine market
  * Fall of crime in the 1990s
    1. Increased number of police
    2. Rising prison population
    3. Receding crack-cocaine epidemic
    4. Legalization of Abortion in 1973
*Factors not supported:* Strong economy, changing
demographics, better policing strategies, gun control laws, conceled
weapons laws, capital punishment.
