Criminology Schools of Thought
==============================

The Big Picture - Larger paradigms that most theories fit into.

1. Demonic/Supernatural - Pre-enlightenment thinking. A Starting point
   on why people commit crimes, violate social/religous norms.
   * Possession
   * Crime caused by evil spirits
   * Punish to appease gods   
   * Brutal for bodies, good for souls
2. Classical - Paradigms are creditable.
   * Rejects brutality
   * Free will, choice, utilitarian principle
   * Individuals *choose* crime, based on rational calculation of cost &
     benefits
   * Deterrence is purpose of punishment
   * Focus on punishing the crime, not the criminals
   * Crimes of same type treated equally
   * Not bad people, bad laws
3. Positivist
   * Rejects free will & idea of "rational" choice
   * Crime is *caused* (determinism) by forces beyond individual
     choice. Similar to Demonic school because the crime is caused by an
     outside force.
   * Science & law over faith & morality (value neutrality)
   * Scientific method = best "way of knowing"
   * Criminals & non-criminals are different in certain ways.
   * Punishment purpose: reform or incapacitation
4. Post-positivist & radical
   * Social & policital systems "create" crime, generally for intended
     purposes
   * Unequal distribution of opportunities set up certain groups to fail
     and made them powerless to defend themselves from "criminal" label
   * The power-brokers in society assign the criminal label to
     lower-classes, minorities
