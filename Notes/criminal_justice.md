Criminal Justice
================

###Goal 1: Deterrence
* Prevention of crime by instilling a fear of punishment in potential
  offenders
  * Specific deterrence
  * General deterrence

###Goal 2: Incapacitation
* Prevention of crime by removing the capacity for crime
* Protecting the public is a major goal of current U.S. Criminal justice
  system

###Goal 3: Rehabilitation
* Preventing additional criminal acts by ameliorating the negative
  social forces that lead individuals into criminality
  * Goal of punishment is to help reform individual behavior & help them
    to be productive citizens.

###Goal 4: Retribution
* Of the four goals, only one without a crime prevention purpose
* Punishment of offenders occurs because **they deserve it**
  * "Just deserts"
  * Punishment is a moral obligation
  * Punishment equalizes disadvantage caused by crime (zero-sum)

A Brief History of Modern American Criminal Justice
---------------------------------------------------
* David Garland notes two noteworthy epochs:
  * 1890s to 1960s
  * 1970s to Present

###1890 - 1970 Penal Welfare and Rehabilitation Model
* Sociologist David Garland (2001)
* Basic axiom:
  * "Criminal Justice", whenever possible, should involve rehabilitative
    interventions rather than negative, retributive measures.

###Characteristics of Penal-Welfare System
* Indeterminate sentences
  * Linked to probation, parole & early release
* Individualized sentences
  * By social and psychiatric study & expert assessment
* Separation of juvenile and adult justice
  * "Child-welfare" main goal of juvenile system
* Incarceration as "re-education"
* Re-integrative support upon release
