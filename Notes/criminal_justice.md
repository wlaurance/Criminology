Criminal Justice
================

###Goal 1: Deterrence
* Prevention of crime by instilling a fear of punishment in potential
  offenders
  * Specific deterrence
  * General deterrence

###Goal 2: Incapacitation
* Prevention of crime by removing the capacity for crime
* Protecting the public is a major goal of current U.S. Criminal justice
  system

###Goal 3: Rehabilitation
* Preventing additional criminal acts by ameliorating the negative
  social forces that lead individuals into criminality
  * Goal of punishment is to help reform individual behavior & help them
    to be productive citizens.

###Goal 4: Retribution
* Of the four goals, only one without a crime prevention purpose
* Punishment of offenders occurs because **they deserve it**
  * "Just deserts"
  * Punishment is a moral obligation
  * Punishment equalizes disadvantage caused by crime (zero-sum)

A Brief History of Modern American Criminal Justice
---------------------------------------------------
* David Garland notes two noteworthy epochs:
  * 1890s to 1960s
  * 1970s to Present

###1890 - 1970 Penal Welfare and Rehabilitation Model
* Sociologist David Garland (2001)
* Basic axiom:
  * "Criminal Justice", whenever possible, should involve rehabilitative
    interventions rather than negative, retributive measures.

###Characteristics of Penal-Welfare System
* Indeterminate sentences
  * Linked to probation, parole & early release
* Individualized sentences
  * By social and psychiatric study & expert assessment
* Separation of juvenile and adult justice
  * "Child-welfare" main goal of juvenile system
* Incarceration as "re-education"
* Re-integrative support upon release

###Problems Encountered by Rehab
* Problem 1
  * A gap developed between the length of sentence received & time
    actually served.
* Problem 2
  * Crime also increased rapidly through the 1960s and early 1970s
* These problems raised concerns about the effectiveness of the
  rehabilitative model.

###Critiques "across the aisle"
Cynicism towards penal-welfare model took two paths:
1. **Liberals**:
  * Rehabilitation wasn't working
  * Indeterminate sentencing = unjust outcomes for racial minorities &
    the poor ( race & class bias )
2. **Conservative**
  * Rehabilitative model was too soft on crime 
  * Indeterminate sentences were partially to blame (no "truth in
    sentencing")

###1970-Present: Enter the Punitive Model
Robert Martinson (1974)
  * "What Works in Prison Reform"
    * Analysis of 231 evaluation studies 1945-1967
    * Conslusion: *"With few and isolated exceptions, the rehabilitative efforts that have been reported so far have had no appreciable effect of recidivism"*

Liberal Response
* Suggested reforms:
  1. Punishments proportional to offense severity
  2. Determinate sentencing = fair treatment for all
  3. Offender civil rights Due Process protections
  4. Incarceration alternative when warranted
  5. Decriminalize victimless offenses

Conservative Response
1. Focus on deterrence
  * Offenders choose crime, so punish to deter
2. Public Safety is a major obligation of state
3. Incapacitation is a legitimate purpose
  * Sever punishment justified by victims rights
4. Truth in sentencing
  * Determinate sentences & mandatory minimums
5. Reduce technicalities
  * Too many offenders are let go b/c of due process technicalities
6. Reduce juvenile/adult distinction
  * for very serious crimes, age is not a mitigating condition

What was the end result?

* A blend of liberal and conservative responses
* A more punitive system in which lengthy & determinate sentences are
  common
* Rehab purposes neglected
* Declining age at which juveniles are charged as adults; greater
  transfer exceptions more automatic transfer
* Incarceration rates have skyrocketed
  * Partially due to long term sentencing.
