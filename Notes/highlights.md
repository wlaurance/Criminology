Criminology
===========

How do experts define crime?
----------------------------
* Tappan - Legal Definition
* Edwin Sutherland - White Colar Crimes
* Marcus Felson - Consensus
* Richard Quinney - human conduct
* Gottfredson/Hirschi - acts of force or fraud in the pursuit of self
  interest
* Dirkhiem - boundaries, keep them in check.

Different Views
---------------
* *Consensus View* - majority agrees on behavioral norms; criminal law
  follows these norms.
* *Conflict View* - econmically powerful define what is criminal to
  protect their economic intersts.
* *Constructionist* - crim is socially constructed/ reconstructed.

Whose morality is reflected in the law?
---------------------------------------
Law as problem solver - Murder vs underage drinking agreement, consensus
of underlying morals.

Law as problem creator - Drug trade, labels, groups and corruption

1. Liberalism - harm principle
2. Legal ("welfare") Paternalism
3. Legal Moralism - contrains behavior that if persisted damage moral
   fabric of society.
4. Moral Paternalism - Emphasis on moral harm to the person.

Problems arise when using law to enforce morality
-------------------------------------------------
1. If the law is not based upon a *widely-accepted moral befiefs*, it
   will be ineffective. Sutherland & Cressey: "When moral norms are
adequate, law is unnecessary; when moral norms are inadequate, law in
ineffective.
2. Private behaviors are hard to find.
3. When it comes to goods & services ( drugs, gambling, sex), the law
   creates a "crime tax" that drives up prices.
4. Legislating private morality may create a new permanent class of
   "criminals". "minor" offenders, e.g. drug users, get sticky CONVICT
label. Potential enforcement bias by race and class. a "Profile"

Placing limits on utilzation of law to regulate morality
---------------------------------------------------------
Herbet Packer's _The Limits of the Criminal Sanction_ 
1. Behavior is socially threatening to most
2. Behavior can be addressed though fair and non-discriminatory
3. Controlling the behavior will not severely strain the criminal
   justice process.
4. No reasonable alternatives tot he criminal sanction exists.
