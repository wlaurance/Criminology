Control Theory
===============
Asking 'why someone commits crime' is the wrong question.
We don't need to explain positive motivation to criminal offending.
The better question is why **don't** people commit crimes?
Humans have a natural inclination to pursue their wants and desires (
pure control theory)

Motivation is given. Motivation for crime generally viewed as equal for
all people. *Contraint or control* is what needs to be explained. 

Containment Theory - Walter Reckless
------------------------------------
A wider view of crime causation than other control theories. Motivations
for crime are variable across people. Inherent biological or
psychological crime motivations or propensities. Social pressures and
Social pulls. In places with great social pressures and pulls, how do
you explain the non-criminals?
###Inner Containment
Strong conscience, good "self concept"; high frustration tolerance;
Concept of self as a "good kid" or "bad kid" formed by age 12. 
###Outer Containment 
effective social supports, a consistent morality among one's family and
community. Either type could prevent crime; inner more effective
especially in socially disorganized places.

Travis Hirschi's Social Bonding Theory 1969
-------------------------------------------
  * **Causes of Delinquency** - Became most prominent control theory,
    superseding earlier control theories.
  * **General Proposition** - Crime is likely when the "bond" between an
    individual and conventional society is weak or broken.
  * **Elements**
    * Attachment - extent of emotional ties to parents, friends,
      teachers. Encompasses notions of conscience, self-control,
      superego. Attachment itself is control, "character" of others is
      irrelevant.
    * Commitment - rational investment in conventional society; what you
      risk; "stakes in conformity"    
    * Involvement - idle hands are the devil's workshop; amount of time
      spent doing conventional activities.
    * Belief - extent to which you accept and are obligated to follow
      the rules of conventinal society, whether you see the criminal law
      as just.
